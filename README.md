# STUDIO_X_Press

“If we don’t think about the future in and with all the transformative regions of the world, then we are not thinking about the future.”
– Mark Wigley, Dean GSAPP

Studio X means a studio defined by its 4 walls and ceiling within which anything could happen.  The space of a Studio X event is associated with a series of physical condition of the local weather, temperature, and even humidity, together they enrich your experience of the event. While the events are often nicely documented, the spatial experience from the events are barely touched on by any of its media effort. Now imagine the spaces of these studios would actually twit about the event in their own perspective, and document the event by it's environmental thresholds, a space with vocality emerges as a press service that reverse the object and subject in the usual architectural conversation. 
How does it work? Light, sound, humidity and temperature are taken by respective sensors in real time, combined with event information and a guess check in information. When threshold condition is met, building twits, and message fires away, here is an example, "it's 106 degree and 100 percent humidity outside in Rio, but Studio X Rio is a full house tonight, and the crowd has just gone quiet as the lecture of Building Culture is about to start!" Rising of the room temperature and ambient sound level from discussion and party mingling activities will initiate the photo capturing sequence, the higher the ambient sound level, the more frequence the images are taking. The bot twits, "Discussion heats up and party are about about to start."
